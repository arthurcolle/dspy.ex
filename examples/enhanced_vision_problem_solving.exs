    This is a comprehensive systems design problem that involves multiple components and considerations.
    
    Background: You are designing a distributed microservices architecture for a large e-commerce platform 
    that needs to handle millions of requests per day. The system must support:
    
    1. User Management: Registration, authentication, profile management, preferences
    2. Product Catalog: Search, filtering, recommendations, inventory tracking
    3. Shopping Cart: Session management, persistence, real-time updates
    4. Order Processing: Payment processing, fraud detection, order fulfillment
    5. Shipping: Logistics optimization, tracking, delivery scheduling
    6. Customer Service: Chat support, ticket management, knowledge base
    7. Analytics: Real-time monitoring, business intelligence, performance metrics
    8. Security: Data encryption, access control, audit logging, compliance
    
    Technical Requirements:
    - 99.9% uptime
    - Sub-100ms response times for 95% of requests
    - Support for 10x traffic spikes during sales events
    - GDPR and PCI DSS compliance
    - Multi-region deployment
    - Auto-scaling capabilities
    - Disaster recovery with RPO < 1 hour
    
    Constraints:
    - Budget limitations require cost optimization
    - Legacy systems must be gradually migrated
    - Team has limited expertise in certain technologies
    - Regulatory requirements vary by geographic region
    - Integration with existing third-party services required
    
    Current Infrastructure:
    - Monolithic application on legacy servers
    - MySQL database with performance bottlenecks
    - Limited monitoring and observability
    - Manual deployment processes
    - No containerization or orchestration
    
    Please provide a comprehensive solution that addresses all these requirements while managing the complexity and constraints.
