Demonstrate autonomous architectural evolution where the system:

1. ANALYZES CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:
   - Maps all system components and their relationships
   - Identifies architectural bottlenecks and limitations
   - Assesses scalability and performance characteristics
   - Evaluates maintainability and technical debt

2. DESIGNS EVOLUTIONARY IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Proposes architectural refactoring strategies
   - Designs new architectural patterns for better performance
   - Creates migration plans with minimal disruption
   - Validates improvements through simulation and analysis

3. IMPLEMENTS GRADUAL EVOLUTION:
   - Applies architectural changes incrementally
   - Maintains system functionality during evolution
   - Monitors impact of each architectural change
   - Rolls back changes that negatively impact the system

4. VALIDATES AND OPTIMIZES:
   - Comprehensive testing of architectural changes
   - Performance benchmarking and comparison
   - Optimization of new architectural components
   - Documentation of architectural evolution

5. LEARNS FROM EVOLUTION:
   - Builds knowledge base of successful architectural patterns
   - Identifies factors that lead to successful evolution
   - Develops predictive models for architectural success
   - Continuously improves evolution strategies

The system should demonstrate sophisticated architectural thinking and
the ability to evolve its own structure for better performance and capabilities.
