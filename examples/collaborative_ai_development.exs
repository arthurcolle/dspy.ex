# Create a competitive scenario where multiple agent teams compete
competition_scenario = """
Create a competitive development scenario where multiple agent teams 
compete to build the best solution while also sharing certain innovations
for the benefit of the overall ecosystem.

Challenge: Build next-generation blockchain infrastructure that solves
the blockchain trilemma (scalability, security, decentralization) while
maintaining interoperability and sustainability.

Competition Rules:
1. Teams compete on performance, innovation, and user experience
2. Security discoveries must be shared among all teams
3. Sustainability improvements benefit all implementations
4. Interoperability standards are developed collaboratively
5. Final evaluation considers both individual excellence and collective advancement
